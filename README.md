### How it works
Assassin Spoons is a fun game that you and your friends can play with Microsoft Bands and an Android phone! Hit your target with a spoon. But, avoid being assassinated! You will see your target on the map if you're in a range of 150 meters from your target, but wait! If you're in range of your target for 30 seconds or more, your target will receive a notification and vibration of you hunting them!

You yourself are also being hunted! Check the Android app or check the Microsoft Band tile to see if your assassin has been brooding around the area to assassinate you. Last man standing wins!
